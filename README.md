## Using a reverse proxy

In environments with more then one web applications it is necessary to use a reverse proxy to route connections to port 80 and 443 to the right application.
To run Zammad behind a reverse proxy, we provide `docker-compose.proxy-example.yml` as a starting point.

1. Copy `./.examples/proxy/docker-compose.proxy-example.yml` to your own configuration, e.g. `./docker-compose.prod.yml`
    `cp ./.examples/proxy/docker-compose.proxy-example.yml ./docker-compose.prod.yml`
2. Modify the environment variable `VIRTUAL_HOST` and the name of the external network in `./docker-compose.prod.yml` to fit your environment.
3. Run docker-composer commands with the default and your configuration, e.g. `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`

See `.examples/proxy/docker-compose.yml` for an example proxy project.

Like this, you can add your `docker-compose.prod.yml` to a branch of your Git repository and stay up to date by merging changes to your branch.

## Using Rancher

```console
RANCHER_URL=http://RANCHER_HOST:8080 rancher-compose --env-file=.env up
```

## Running without Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is an optional, but strongly recommended dependency for Zammad. More details can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/prerequisites/software.html#elasticsearch-optional). There are however certain scenarios when running without Elasticsearch may be desired, e.g. for very small teams, for teams with limited budget or as a temporary solution for an unplanned Elasticsearch downtime or planned cluster upgrade.

Elasticsearch is enabled by default in the example `docker-compose.yml` file. It is also by default required to run the "zammad-init" command. Disabling Elasticsearch is possible by setting a special environment variable: `ELASTICSEARCH_ENABLED=false` for the `zammad-init` container and removing all references to Elasticsearch everywhere else: the `zammad-elasticsearch` container, its volume and links to it.
